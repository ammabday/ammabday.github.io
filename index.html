                How do I begin to thank you for all that you have done to me. Everyday you constantly put your family before youself. You work endlessly each day to see your family prosper. I cannot begin to show how much I appreciate all you do for me. You make sure that I do my best in everything, and that I will succeed. I can say without any doubt that I would not have accomplished all I've done without your support. Eventhough you constantly remind me to study everyday, or finish all my tasks, I know you do it out of love and care. I am truly thankful to have a mother like you and I hope you have a great day.

            </p>
